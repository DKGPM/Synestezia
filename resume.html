        <h2>Resumé</h2>
         <p><strong>At the beginning of the thesis</strong> , we introduced synesthesia, explained the origin and specified in more detail the various forms and symptoms of this phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, we described the three main causes of synesthesia acquisition. We focused on various options for preventing synesthetic experiences. We drew this acquired knowledge from book and internet sources.</p> 
            <p><strong>In the next step</strong> , we worked out the questions, through which we managed to conduct an interview with the synaesthete, musicologist Oskar Lehotský. We found the contact needed to address the already mentioned person through the official website of the Center for Traditional Folk Culture. Thanks to his personal experience, we were able to understand in more detail the distinction between synesthetic experiences and ordinary sensory perceptions. And thus contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon. At the same time, we managed to dispel a common myth circulating about synesthesia, namely its connection with mental disorders.<p>
            <p>In this way, we have fulfilled one of the main goals of our work. We successfully compared our respondent's synesthetic experiences with those of other synaesthetes. At the same time, we discovered the presence of synesthesia in several people in Slovakia.<p>
            <p>We are satisfied with the results of our work.<p>
